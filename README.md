# Object-Oriented Design and Modeling (OODM) with UML Diagrams

This repository explores the core concepts of Object-Oriented Design and Modeling (OODM) using various UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams. It provides visual representations to illustrate system interactions, workflows, and object relationships for efficient system design.

## Diagrams Included

The repository features the following UML diagrams:

- **Class Diagram**: Describes the static structure of a system, showing its classes, their attributes, and relationships.
- **Activity Diagram**: Represents the workflow or business process of the system, highlighting the sequence of activities.
- **Collaboration Diagram**: Illustrates the interaction between objects in terms of message passing.
- **Use Case Diagram**: Depicts the system's functionality from the user's perspective, showing use cases and actors.
- **Communication Diagram**: Focuses on the interactions between objects, highlighting their communication paths.
- **Sequence Diagram**: Shows how objects interact over time, focusing on the sequence of messages exchanged.

## Tools Used

To create these diagrams, the following tools were used:

- **StarUML**: A powerful UML tool that provides an intuitive interface for creating and visualizing various UML diagrams. It supports both forward and reverse engineering of models and offers a wide range of diagram types.
  
- **PlantUML**: A tool that allows for the generation of UML diagrams from plain text descriptions. It is particularly useful for quick and easy diagram creation directly from code or documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To view and edit the UML diagrams, you will need:

- **StarUML**: Download and install [StarUML](https://staruml.io/) on your system.
- **PlantUML**: Use [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) via its website, integrated in IDEs, or via command-line for rendering diagrams from text.

### Usage

You can find the UML diagrams in this repository within the respective files. Use StarUML or PlantUML to open and edit these diagrams for better understanding or modification.
